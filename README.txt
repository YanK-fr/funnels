Funnels 0.2 - 20/10/10
----------------------
* Updated example URL in funnel creation/edit to be absolute
* Fixed primary key on log_funnel_step table - missing column idfunnel was preventing one action from being recorded as a step in more than one funnel. To fix manually, run the following against your database:
	ALTER TABLE [piwik_table_prefix]_log_funnel_step DROP PRIMARY KEY, ADD PRIMARY KEY(`idvisit`, `idfunnel`, `idstep`);
